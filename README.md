# Pixel-Manipulation-For-Image-Encryption-
This project focuses on basic image encryption using pixel manipulation techniques. The tool encrypts an image by modifying pixel values through simple mathematical operations or pixel swapping and allows decryption by reversing the process. It provides experience with image processing, array manipulation,working with image libraries in Python
